# Recipes

A number of complex scenarios such as distributed locks, barriers, queues, leadership providers can be implemented using simple ZooKeeper building blocks. These algorithms are explained in detail in the official ZK [documentation](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/recipes.html). Currently, only distributed locks are implemented in `Vostok.ZooKeeper.Recipes`.
